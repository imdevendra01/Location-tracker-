A location tracker using HTML and JavaScript leverages the browser's built-in geolocation API to track the user's current geographical location. This API provides information about the user's latitude and longitude, along with other data such as altitude and speed. Below is a description of how it works, followed by a simple code example:

How it Works:
Geolocation API: This is a feature built into most modern browsers that allows websites to request the user's location. Permission is required from the user before their location is shared.
Accuracy: The location data provided by the API can be very accurate (within a few meters), depending on the user's device (e.g., smartphones can use GPS, Wi-Fi, or cellular networks for accuracy).
HTML Integration: The HTML interface is minimal, often consisting of buttons to start or stop tracking and displaying the retrieved location.
JavaScript Functions: JavaScript handles the logic of requesting location data, processing it, and displaying it on the page or sending it to a server for tracking.
